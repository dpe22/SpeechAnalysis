# MVP User Story
As a person who wants to get tested for COVID-19 at any time in any location with access to a smartphone, I want to get my results instantly, with minimal cost, minimal travel distance, minimal interaction with other people (potential to infect others), as many times as I want,  with a high level of sensitivity (high true positive rate) and high specificity (high true negative rate) because I want to help limit the spread of COVID-19 from symptomatic individuals and prevent unnecessary death and hospitalization.
