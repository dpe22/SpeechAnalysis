# MVP User Stories
As a student or employee who is required to be tested for COVID-19 every week, I want to be able to complete my test without traveling to or having to schedule an appointment with the testing location. I want to complete my test without interacting with my roommates/family and others on campus/office in case I'm infected. I want to complete my test without the discomfort of sticking a swab up my nose, especially in dry weather. I need the test to be very fast because sometimes I procrastinate and I need the test to be very convenient to fit into my busy schedule. 

As a patient in a hospital or care facility, I know I already have been diagnosed with COVID, but I want to leave and get back to normal life as quickly as possible. I want a COVID-19 test that is repeatable without cost, and I need to be able to take the test without violating quarantine. I would appreciate a non-invasive method for daily testing. 

As a citizen of a developing nation, I cannot travel to a testing facility and I have not been offered a vaccine. I need a COVID-19 test that is free and accessible to me and others in my community so that we can work together to limit the spread of COVID without the infrastructure or government assistance provided in wealthier countries. 

As an insurance company, medical provider, or government, I need to limit the spread of COVID-19 to keep medical facilities from being overwhelmed, prevent death and economic hardship, and I need to pay for any testing expense and damage that may result from the virus. I need an accurate COVID-19 test that is cheaper, easier to manufacture and distribute, and effective at stopping the spread of the virus. 

As a person who wants to get tested for COVID-19 at any time in any location with access to a smartphone, I want to get my results instantly, with minimal cost, minimal travel distance, minimal interaction with other people (potential to infect others), as many times as I want,  with a high level of sensitivity (high true positive rate) and high specificity (high true negative rate) because I want to help limit the spread of COVID-19 from symptomatic individuals and prevent unnecessary death and hospitalization.
